# Inland-Fish-and-Warming-Waters-Curriculum
This lesson explores the impact of temperature on four species of inland fish, Brook trout, Brown trout, Yellow bullhead and Carp. 

A warming climate will increase the water temperature and decrease oxygen levels. Participants will investigate water temperatures and
dissolved oxygen levels in local water bodies and consider how to improve habitat for native cold water fish.

Grade Level: Grades 3-8, extension activities for grades 9-12 and further extensions for grades 3-12
